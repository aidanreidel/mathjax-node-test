# Mathjax-SVG-Render-Test

This is a test repo for a node server which we will be using in a production environment to render screen readable math!

## Getting started

According to `node` I am using `v12.5.0`

According to `npm` I am using version `6.9.0`

## How do I use this?

1. Clone the repo: 

    `git clone git@github.com:aidanreidel/mathjax-node-test.git`

2. Change directories into the repo:

    `cd mathjax-svg-render-test`

3. Install dependencies:

    `npm i`

4. Start the server:

    `node index.js`

5. Go to your favorite browser, which we all know is firefox, and navigate to this this address:
    
    `localhost:3000`

Congratulations, you rendered some sweet sweet Mass-Energy Equivalence in what hopefully is a screen readable SVG...
